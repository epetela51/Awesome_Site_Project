# **Landing Page Project - The Odin Project (TOP)**

This is a project under the Flexbox section of TOP that allows you to practice all the development skills that you have learned up to this point.  You can see the requirements [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page)

I mirrored the layout of the mockup page (seen below) but decided to put a spin on it to make a landing page about Apple products to make it stand out a little bit from the mockup using free images found on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

## Skills that were utilized in this project:
* HTML 5
* CSS 3 / Flexbox
* Git
* GitHub

To view this page you can copy the repo and run locally or you can view it [here] (https://epetela51.github.io/Awesome_Site_Project/) from my GitHub pages link
