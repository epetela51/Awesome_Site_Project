# Apple Computers Are Awesome

This is a project that tests what has been learned from The Odin Project relating to HTML, CSS & Flexbox.  I am mirroring a website demo and I twisted it to make it be a page that talks about what is great about Apple computers

Using Flexbox to align content within flex containers, CSS to add text & background colors, fonts & sizes and html to be the bones of the page with the actual content
